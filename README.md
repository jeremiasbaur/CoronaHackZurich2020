## Pitch
### Inspiration
To find out how the society feels at a certain moment in time is of great interest for many - from policy makers that want to support their people where it matters over social entrepreneurs that want to improve the welfare of the society to reporters that want to cover the most important topics and have a positive impact.
But the usual sources of this emontional data often suffer from being highly biased - it only covers a subset of groups within the society, not at the society as a whole.

The topics that concern society the most and the impact of these topics on people's emotions are often found out from singular and limited sources like the frequency of certain Hashtags on Twitter in a certain timespan.
These data streams are typically dominated by technological knowledgeable, educated, adult men and women.
It is obvious that this is not an accurate cross-section of a society as it does not include children, old people and people that enjoyed less education.
These groups amount much larger numbers of people than the clientele of Twitter and are often affected by entirely different issues.
