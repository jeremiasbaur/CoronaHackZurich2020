## Pitch
### Inspiration
To find out how the society feels at a certain moment in time is of great interest for many - from policy makers that want to support their people where it matters over social entrepreneurs that want to improve the welfare of the society to reporters that want to cover the most important topics to have an impact.
But the usual sources of this emontional data often suffer from being highly biased and only look at subset of groups within the society, not at the society as a whole.
